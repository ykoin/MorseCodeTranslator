# MorseCodeTranslator
This Python tool decodes Morse code digits for a CTF challenge at WAT. It maps Morse sequences (e.g., ".----" for 1) to digits, concatenates them into a number string, converts it to an integer, and decodes it as an ASCII/Unicode character. It reads from telegraf.txt and prints the message.
